Blackjack and the use of the Deck Class
=======================================
Creating a deck to hopefully create a game of Blackjack.

The idea here is to create:
 - Card class that captures the "suit" and value of the card
 - Suit class that contains a list/array of cards of the same suit
 - Deck class that contains a list/array of suits

Issue #1:
---------
 - cannot remove an element from the top of the list because AbstractList 
   (which is what Arrays.asList uses) creates an unmodifiable collection. 
 - perhaps what should be done from the beginning is to use a List. And since
   List is a collection, we can use the shuffle method. 
 - RESOLVED

Issue #2:
---------
 - should Blackjack be a class which extends an abstract class of CardGame?
  - what does it mean to have a Blackjack object? Players themselves are part of
    this "object" and the moves allowed are what are permitted within the rules.
    It seems like it would make more sense if the game was an interface and 
    not a class.
 - should Blackjack be an interface that a Blackjack Player would need to
   implement?
  - if it is an interface, than the player would "change" his behavior
    accordingly. The type of moves that are allowed would only be whatever is 
    allowed in the interface. The Blackjack player would have to implement 
    the interface. But how do I encode the list of moves within an interface?
